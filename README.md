# Recipe Manager Project

This is a Ruby on Rails App designed to keep track of recipes with basic CRUD principles. Any user can sign up with an email and a password, or via Facebook. Any user can then create recipes with ingredients. All users can view other people's recipes, but only admins can edit and delete ingredients. 

# Installation

First, fork the repo and install all gems on your computer via this command.

```
bundle install
```

Then, make sure all the database is available via this command.

```
rake db:migrate
```

Finally, with everything set up, start the server on your terminal and open up the server on your browser.

```
rails s
```
